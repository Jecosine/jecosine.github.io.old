			<h2>Brief Introduction of Python</h2>
			<p>As Python become a widely used language,more and more people can't tolerate the emotion of taking a attemption to "play" with python.If you are new to python, reading this article first might help you get better understanding of python rather than walking in a misty forest.</p>
			<h3>Why Choose Python?</h3>
			<p>When we are working on a project,we will prefer to focus more on main implement of program than stack on a small but seems vital details,such as a v customize data structure.If you are using C or C++,you will feel crazy about it.But in Python you might not need to concern it too much because python is 'equiped' with a strong community,and various build-in type(they will be mention in later article in this series).Now let's see a small program do with python.</p>

		imgdata[i][j] = 255 - imgdata[i][j]
Image.fromarray(imgdata).save('002.jpg')
